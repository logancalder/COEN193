# Systems & Performance Research Lab Work
## Introduction
Hello, and welcome to my repository for all undergraduate research that I conducted at Santa Clara University's School of Engineering. I worked as an undergraduate researcher from Fall 2023 through Fall of 2024.

My field of research concerned measuring performance counters of randomized algorithms. Namely, RandBLAS' Dense & Sparse Sketching. I also did work to analyze performance counters for OpenBLAS' DGEMM (Double-precision, General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication).

Under this repository, you may view my work for both areas of research, and I will link to my publications once released.

## Setup
If you are interested in compiling and running the computations yourself, you will need to ensure that you have all dependencies installed and linked to prior to compilation. You may see those prerequisites here:
- [RandBLAS](https://github.com/BallisticLA/RandBLAS/blob/main/INSTALL.md)
- [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS)

All RandBLAS calculations and analysis is stored within ```/sketch/```, whereas OpenBLAS DGEMM is viewable in ```/dgemm/```. Dependencies and other software are installed in ```/software/```.

## More About The Systems & Performance Research Lab
I worked under Dr. Y. Cho, who is an incredibly smart researcher and assistant professor at Santa Clara University. While my work can be viewed here, I also had fellow undergraduate and graduate students working in my lab as well, with more information about their work being viewable on the lab's [website](https://sites.google.com/view/scuspl/home).
